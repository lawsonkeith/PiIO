## PiIO Raspbian administrtion guide

### Image

All examples were witten using raspbian stretch lite.


### Installation

Installation instructions can be found here:

### Dependencies

__Python packages__ 

| Item | Notes |
| ---- | ----- |
| concurrent-futures | python concurrency framework |
| paho-mqtt | python mqtt client |
| gpiozero | python gpio framework |
| smbus | python smbus framework |
| pyowm | python open weather map framework |
| pyserial | required for the 232 board |

All packages need to be installed as root e.g. [sudo pip3 install paho-mqtt]


__linux packages__

| Item | Notes |
| ---- | ----- |
| mosquitto | mqtt broker |
| python3.5 | Varsion 3.5+ |
| python-pip3 | package installer for python |
| git | revision control package |
| node red | user interface and / or control via mqtt |
 
* All packages can be installed using apt-get e.g. [sudo apt-get install python-pip3]  
* Use [python3 --version] to find out what version you are running.
 
 
### Auto boot programs

* The file __etc/rc.local__ can be modified to automatically boot python programs after a reboot.
* To subsequently kill this program use the command [sudo killall python3]
* Use command [ps -A | grep python] to check if it is running


### Basic config of stretch

Use [sudo raspi-config] to perform the following basic tasks.

* __Enable ssh__ required for remote admin i.e. no keyboard and monitor
* __SPI / I2C / Serial__ board specific, see boar docs for info.  Must be set correctly!
* __Enable wifi__ required if LAN cable not used

Further notes on how to do this can be found here:  
[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md]


### Remote management

Can be done once wifi is setup using ssh and by editing files using nano.  
A terminal debugger is provided in some of the examples to help.  _Putty_ is a good program for doing this via windows and it comes with a file transfer utility called _pscp_ which can be used to copy files from windows to the pi.

```

2.5Ghz wifi has better range than 5Ghz, but may suffer more from interference and the dongles are more powerful than onboard wifi.


### Local management

If possible it's easer to hook a monitor and keyboard up to the pi and edit the files locally as the range of editors will be much better if you use the destop version of stretch.  
If you can using a LAN cable is more reliable than wifi also, you'll find wifi has limited range and generally suffers interference problems from devices such as cordless telephones.
If you do this you can substitute __nano__ out for __geany__, __gedit__ or __thonny__ (the best)  


### Debugging

Some of the examples are included with a terminal debugger to facilitate command line debugging.  The debugger can also accept keyboard input.

Python can also be debugged using the _Thonny_ editor which has a built in debugger but requires a desktop environment to run.
